# General Description #
This will generate the unitary group of specified size. The algorithm is not optimized so this is probably not the
fastest way to do it but I won't ever use it for large numbers and I can't find a webgenerator online, so this will do
for now.

# Usage #
php Views/cli.php N (e.g php Views/cli.php 30 will print U(30))
